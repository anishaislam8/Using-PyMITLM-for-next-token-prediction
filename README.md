# Next token prediction using N-gram models

This project contains the code for predicting next tokens given a context using n-gram models. We have used PyMITLM for this purpose, introduced in https://github.com/hazelybell/MIT-Language-Modeling-Toolkit/tree/267325017f60dee86caacd5b207eacdc50a3fc32.
