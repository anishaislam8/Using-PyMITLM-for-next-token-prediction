If you have Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>:

    # Install some random dude's tap; he has a formula for ZeroMQ C++.
    brew tap bertjwregeer/compat
    # Install gcc (needed for gfortran), glibtool, Boost, ZeroMQ and its C++
    # bindings.
    brew install gcc libtool boost zeromq cppmq
    # Then install as normal.
    ./autogen.sh
